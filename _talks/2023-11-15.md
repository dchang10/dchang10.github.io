This was a continuation of a previous talk I gave at the IAS about [Bayesian inference on LLAGN with semi-analytic models](/talks/2023-11-02). Julia Kerr Blackhüï≥Ô∏èle eXtractor (JuKeBOX) was the tentative name of the model at the time of presenting. I showed final results of the project which will be written up in a paper later.
