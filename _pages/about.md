# Who am I?

I am currently a physics graduate student. My interest are in Blackholes physics and gravitation. I like to learn about random things and am attracted to engaging conversations. In my spare time, I sometimes work on coding projects and make bad music demos. You can checkout some of my coding projects in [*PhysicsApps*]({% link _pages/physicsapps.md%})
