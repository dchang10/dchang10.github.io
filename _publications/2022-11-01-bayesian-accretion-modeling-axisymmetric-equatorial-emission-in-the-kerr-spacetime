excerpt: 'The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has produced images of two supermassive black holes, Messier 87* (M87*) and Sagittarius A* (SgrA*). The EHT collaboration used these images to indirectly constrain black hole parameters by calibrating measurements of the sky-plane emission morphology to images of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations...'

Can you directly infer physical parameters from EHT data? 
We try to answer this question with the Kerr Bayesian Analytic Modelling (KerrBAM) code. 
This code is useful since it produces General Relativistic Hydrodynamics (GRMHD) like images at many orders of magnitude faster speeds. 
We use this model to produce Bayesian posteriors that quantify the probability of the blackhole and the fluid having certain physical parameters.
